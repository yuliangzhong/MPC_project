Describe and interpret what you can see in T6-1/T6-2

What qualitative influences do changes of the diagonal elements in Q and R have? (T7)

Discuss about T8 result

What can you conclude from the T9 plot with regards to state and constraint satisfaction?

Compare difference between T11 and T7-8

Why is the origin an asymptotically stable equilibrium point for the resulting closed-loop system, given that (E8) is feasible for x(0)? 

Compare the closed-loop trajectories as well as the optimization costs J_MPC for your three MPC controllers on T (0) = T(1)_init 
and T (0) = T(2)_init. Discuss the differences.
