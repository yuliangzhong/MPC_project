# MPC project

## Introduction
In this Model Predictive Control (MPC) project, we implement a variety of controllers for temperature regulation of a vaccination center.

More details, check "instructions.pdf".

## Tasks

1. Build a model and discretize it. Simulate it without any controller.
2. Unconstrained LQR controller for LTI systems.
3. Compute initial constraints for x(0)_LQR.
4. Basic MPC implementation.
5. MPC with theoretical closed loop guarantees (feasibility and stability) 
   (zero terminal; terminate in LQR feasible set).
6. Soft constraint MPC.
